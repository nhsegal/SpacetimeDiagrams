      <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
      This is a spacetime diagram. It's like a position-time graph with the axes
      inverted; time is the vertical axis and position is the horizontal axis. A
      vertical line represents something at rest (i.e. maintaining the same
      location as time progresses). The time and position axes of two coordinate 
      systems in relative motion are different. This is because something at rest in one 
      frame must be in motion in the other frame. 

      <h2>Why are there two sets of axes?</h2>
      These represent two different frames of reference in relative motion. At t = 0,
      the origin of the two frames coincide. 
      Initially the red frame is moving at +0.6c with respect to the black frame.
      This can be changed with velocity sliders. The velocity are all with respect to the initial 
      black frame of reference.

      <h2>What do the green dashed lines represent?</h2>
      These represent light signals emited at t = 0. 

      <h2>What are the units for each axis and for velocity?</h2>
      Time is measured in years and position in lightyears. 
      That's why the light signals have a slope of one. Light moves one lightyear per year.

      <h2>Why are the axes of a moving frame tilted?</h2> 
      Since the red frame is in motion with respect to black, an object with a constant position in the red 
      frame is moving with constant velocity in the black frame. 
      A line along the time axis represents an object with constant position zero. Thus, the red time axis is tilted 
      with respect to the black time axis.

      <h2>But why is the position axis also tilted?</h2> 
      This is necessary so that the speed of light in the moving frame is still one lightyear per year. 

      <h2>What is "Show Future"?</h2>
      Let's say we are at position zero at the instant t = 0. For both red and black this is the same location and same time.
      The future are all events that happen after t = 0. What's consider to be in the future is different for red and for black. 

      <h2>What is "Display Events"?</h2>
      An event is a coordinate in spacetime - a particular time and place. The checkbox "Display Events" shows
      a few of these. The viewer can practice calculating the spacetime separation between the various points in different 
      the coordinate systems. This sim is intended for use with a worksheet that would guide the viewer through such
      calculations and their interpretation.
